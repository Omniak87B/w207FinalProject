    "In this report, we will attempt to predict the forest cover type (defined as the predominant type of tree cover) for a given area of land in Colorado given only cartographic variables as inputs.  This problem and dataset were initially posted as a Kaggle competition in 2015.  We have chosen to tackle this problem as it allows for many different machine learning techniques to be attempted and explored.  The report will go through the process of building a capable model from data cleaning through final testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of understanding what type of vegetation is present in a difficult to access area is a surprisingly important one.  In this particular example the forests of Colorado are very diverse, and each type of tree cover has its own benefits and dangers.  For example, many of the pine trees in Colorado are susceptible to the [mountain pine beetle](https://csfs.colostate.edu/forest-management/common-forest-insects-diseases/mountain-pine-beetle/), while the Spruce and Fir trees are relatively safe from the beetles.  Without directly going to every location in the mountains of Colorado, it is very difficult to distinguish these types of trees as they look very similar from the air.  It is relatively easy to get cartographic data for a large swath of the mountains, however, and if it is possible to accurately predict the tree type from the cartographic information alone then all of the Colorado forest could be mapped by likely forest cover type. That information would be invaluable to firefighters and forest service personnel to direct their efforts where it will have the most impact.\n",

It brings all of the features into a simlilar range, meaning that the models will not end up with widely varying coefficients due to the differing scales of features.  By ensuring all features exist within a given range, we eliminate the possibility that a feature could dominate the weighting and prediction process simply by virtue of having a range that is a few orders of magnitude greater than that of another (potentially more meaningful) feature.   We will experiment with several different types of standardization to see which is the most effective.

    "In the above analysis, some of the models' performance as measured by precision and recall varied widely across cover types. Most of the models did well with `Cottonwood/Willow` and poorly with `Lodgepole Pine`. We might be able to improve our results by drawing upon the strengths of each different model and take a vote to maximize the overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use an ensemble model for this purpose. However, we also know that if our top model to date, Random Forest (RF), is more accurate than other models, there is a possibility that the noise level from the poorly performing models will reduce overall performance of the ensemble. To diagnose this, we write our code in such a way that we can also see inside the ensemble, to assess how each individual model performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to RF, we have also tested KNN, LinearSVC and Logistic Regression models. We should take the opportunity to check other classifiers and see if they can beat our RF model. It is also important to model an ensemble of these various models with and optimizing different parameters to see if we can find a better alternative model. This is a costly and time consuming approach. Executing a GridSearch with multiple model ensembles each with 2-3 parameters often takes hours of processing even on high-end machines with many CPU cores. We, therefore, individually tested and optimized parameters for addition models such as MLP Classifier, Ada Boost, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Gaussian Process Classifier. Addditionally, we also varied the hyperparameters for KNN and RF individually to see the best outcome in each model. Finally, we created an ensemble model with 9 models in a \"hard\" and a \"soft\" voting model to see if we can get the best outcome.  \n",

    "#### Results\n",
    "Initial result showed what we suspected. The overall effect of the ensemble models were lower than the random forest. This is because the other models were adding noise to the overall. We then started process of elimination to get the best possible combination. Our simple RF can only be beaten by an ensemble model composed of KNN and RF. "
